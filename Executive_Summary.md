## Executive Summary

This capstone project investigates the Mexican restaurant industry with the goal of understanding demand–supply
imbalances, consumer behavior, and investment opportunities. The analysis integrates restaurant attributes, consumer
demographics, cuisine preferences, and ratings data into a **star-schema model** and delivers insights through a
one-page Power BI dashboard. The work is guided by four core business questions.

**Q1. Market Overview – Where is supply concentrated?**  
The distribution of restaurants is relatively even across Mexican cities, but **San Luis Potosí** stands out as having
the highest concentration. Despite this concentration, the city maintains diversity in price tiers and cuisines, making
it a strategic location for expansion. Restaurant density in other cities is balanced, ensuring that no city is without
representation.

**Q2. Consumer Profile – Who are the consumers and what do they prefer?**  
The **largest demographic group is students**, most of whom are single, independent, and without children. This
demographic is price-sensitive and favors venues that balance affordability with social experience. Transportation data
indicates reliance on **cars and public transport**, underscoring the need for restaurants to be accessible. Cuisine
preferences lean toward **Mexican & Regional cuisines**, but with notable demand for **Asian** and **Italian** options
as well.

**Q3. Market Gaps – Which cuisines are underserved?**  
The **Demand–Supply Gap analysis** reveals that **Mexican & Regional cuisines** exhibit the largest unmet demand,
with a **gap score of ~0.89**. This means demand share significantly exceeds supply share, signaling clear market
opportunity. Other cuisine groups, such as **Asian** and **International/Modern**, also show moderate gaps worth
exploring. By contrast, categories like **Fast Food** and **Bakery/Desserts** are well supplied, leaving limited room
for differentiation.

**Q4. Investment Lens – Which characteristics should investors back?**  
Analysis of restaurant attributes highlights several winning factors:
- **Pricing:** Low and mid-tier restaurants attract the largest share of consumers, especially students.  
- **Alcohol & Smoking policies:** The top-rated restaurant (ID 132955) allowed smoking and served wine/beer,
suggesting that such policies can positively influence customer ratings in some markets.  
- **Franchise vs Independent:** Independents are more common, but franchises provide consistency that may appeal to
price-sensitive but quality-conscious students.  
- **City target:** Expansion opportunities are strongest in **San Luis Potosí** and other student-heavy regions.  

### Key Findings
- **San Luis Potosí** is the top city for restaurant concentration and student-driven demand.  
- **Students** dominate the consumer base, shaping affordability and cuisine preferences.  
- **Mexican & Regional cuisines** are underserved, creating a strong investment case.  
- **Attributes that matter:** affordable pricing, beverage offerings, and clear lifestyle policies (alcohol/smoking).  

### Recommendations
1. **Expand Mexican & Regional capacity**, where demand far exceeds current supply.  
2. **Target student-rich catchments** like San Luis Potosí with mid-price restaurants.  
3. **Experiment with lifestyle policies** (alcohol/smoking), aligned with local norms, to enhance consumer appeal.  
4. **Balance franchise expansion with independent innovation**, ensuring accessibility while meeting diverse student needs.  

This project demonstrates how **data-driven insights** can reveal hidden opportunities in the restaurant sector,
providing actionable guidance for entrepreneurs, investors, and policymakers aiming to align restaurant supply with
consumer demand.
